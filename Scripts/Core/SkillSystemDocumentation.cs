/// POLISHED SKILL SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION
/// 
/// The skill system has been completely polished and enhanced with the following improvements:
/// 
/// ?? EXECUTION SMOOTHNESS:
/// - Enhanced timing system that uses animation length for optimal execution delays
/// - Smooth skill activation with better input handling and validation
/// - Improved cooldown management with dual system (slot-based + legacy compatibility)
/// - Enhanced visual feedback for all skill types
/// 
/// ?? DAMAGE ZONE MARKING:
/// - Precise damage area visualization with custom prefab support
/// - Enhanced material system with transparency, emission, and glow effects
/// - Pulsing and fade-out animations for better visual appeal
/// - Individual hit effects for each enemy with critical hit differentiation
/// - Particle effects for damage areas, hits, and preview indicators
/// 
/// ? SKILL EXECUTION FLOW:
/// 1. Input Detection ? Enhanced validation and feedback
/// 2. Preview Phase ? Smooth visual indicators with real-time updates
/// 3. Execution Phase ? Optimized timing based on animation length
/// 4. Damage Application ? Bulletproof enemy detection with multi-layer validation
/// 5. Visual Feedback ? Enhanced effects with particles and fade-outs
/// 
/// ?? TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
/// - Bulletproof player detection system preventing self-damage
/// - Enhanced enemy finding with comprehensive filtering
/// - Smooth preview updates with interpolation
/// - Better error handling and validation throughout
/// - Comprehensive logging and debugging support
/// 
/// ?? USAGE EXAMPLES:
/// 
/// // Equip a skill to slot
/// skillManager.EquipSkill(0, mySkillModule);
/// 
/// // Check if skill can be executed
/// if (slot.CanExecuteSkill(player)) {
///     slot.TryExecuteSkill(player, targetPosition);
/// }
/// 
/// // Get skill information
/// string info = slot.GetSkillInfo();
/// Debug.Log(info); // "[1] Fireball (CD: 2.3s)"
/// 
/// ?? SKILL TYPES SUPPORTED:
/// - Melee: Close-range attacks with area damage around player
/// - Projectile: Ranged attacks with trajectory visualization
/// - Area: AOE attacks with precise mouse targeting
/// - Support: Healing and buff skills with gentle indicators
/// - Instant: Immediate effect skills with flash animations
/// 
/// ?? VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS:
/// - Custom damage zone prefabs with automatic scaling
/// - Enhanced materials with emission and transparency
/// - Particle systems for all effect types
/// - Smooth interpolation and transitions
/// - Color-coded skill type indicators
/// 
/// ?? PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
/// - Efficient object pooling for visual effects
/// - Automatic cleanup with timed destruction
/// - Optimized collision detection for projectiles
/// - Smart caching of frequently accessed components
/// 
/// ?? SAFETY FEATURES:
/// - Multiple layers of player detection for damage prevention
/// - Comprehensive input validation
/// - Error recovery and graceful fallbacks
/// - Extensive debugging and logging support
/// 
/// The system is now production-ready with smooth execution, precise visual feedback,
/// and robust error handling. All damage zones are properly marked and all skill
/// execution flows are optimized for the best player experience.
