?? DEPRECATED: UnifiedSkillSystem - Use SimpleHotkeyChanger instead!
===============================================================================================

This complex overlay system has been replaced by SimpleHotkeyChanger which directly
modifies ModularSkillManager hotkeys without creating conflicting systems.

The old system caused issues where:
- Press "1" ? Works (legacy system)  
- Press "E" ? Works but wrong damage area (overlay system)

New solution:
- SimpleHotkeyChanger directly changes hotkey in ModularSkillManager  
- Only ONE system handles skill execution
- No more dual hotkey conflicts!

To use the new system:
1. Add SimpleHotkeyChanger component to scene
2. Use SkillDetailUI (updated) for UI integration
3. All skills execute through ModularSkillManager with correct mouse positioning
